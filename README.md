# Automatic-Precision-Irrigation-System
It is a Tinkercad based project.
The micro-controller used for this project is ESP32.
The objective of this project was to automatically start the motor for irrigation when the soil moisture level falls down to a critical value and gets switched off automatically after irrigating the soil to a decent moisture level.
